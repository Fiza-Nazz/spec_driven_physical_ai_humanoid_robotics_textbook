# Robot Control & Navigation

This module focuses on the fundamental principles and advanced techniques used to control robot movement and enable autonomous navigation. We'll explore various control architectures and algorithms for path planning and obstacle avoidance.

## Topics to be covered:
*   Control Architectures (e.g., PID)
*   Motion Planning
*   Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
*   Collision Avoidance
*   Path Following
