title: Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics
---

Welcome to "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics: A Practical Guide"!

This book aims to provide a comprehensive and hands-on introduction to the exciting fields of physical Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Humanoid Robotics. Whether you are a beginner curious about how robots work, or an intermediate learner looking to deepen your practical skills, this guide is designed for you.

We will explore fundamental concepts, dive into practical examples, and guide you through building and programming your own robotic systems. Our focus is on bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and real-world application, empowering you to experiment and innovate.

## What You Will Learn

*   **Core Concepts**: Understand the foundational theories behind physical AI and humanoid robotics.
*   **Hands-on Development**: Get your hands dirty with practical code examples and exercises.
*   **System Integration**: Learn how software interfaces with hardware in robotic systems.
*   **Ethical Considerations**: Explore the responsible development and deployment of intelligent robots.


## First Hands-on Example: Hello Robot!

Let's start with a very simple program to greet our robotic friends. This example will help you set up your Python environment and run a basic script.

```
### Setup and Execution

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    *   A text editor (like VS Code) and a terminal/command prompt.

2.  **Save the Code**:
    *   Open your text editor.
    *   Copy the Python code above and paste it into a new file.
    *   Save the file as `hello_robot.py` in a convenient location (e.g., a new folder for your examples).

3.  **Run the Program**:
    *   Open your terminal or command prompt.
    *   Navigate to the directory where you saved `hello_robot.py` using the `cd` command (e.g., `cd path/to/your/examples`).
    *   Execute the script using Python:
        ```bash
        python hello_robot.py
        ```

4.  **Expected Output**:
    You should see the following message printed in your terminal:
    ```
    Hello, Robot!
    ```

Congratulations! You've just run your first robotic-themed program.
