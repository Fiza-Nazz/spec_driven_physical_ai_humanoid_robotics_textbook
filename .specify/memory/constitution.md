# Physical AI Humanoid Book

## Version
1.0.4

## Core Principles

### I. Modularity and Reusability
Code should be organized into independent, reusable modules with well-defined interfaces. This promotes separation of concerns and allows for easier maintenance and testing.

### II. Rigorous Testing
All new code must be accompanied by a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests. A Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach is strongly encouraged. All tests must pass before code is merged.

### III. Clear and Concise Documentation
All modules, public APIs, and complex business logic must be clearly documented. Documentation should be kept up-to-date with any code changes.

### IV. Version Control with Git
All code changes must be tracked using Git. Commits should be atomic and accompanied by clear and descriptive messages that explain the "what" and "why" of the change.

### V. Code Style and Linting
A consistent code style must be enforced using automated linting tools. This ensures readability and maintainability of the codebase. Project-specific style guides will be defined and checked in CI.

### VI. Security & Integrity
Ensure resources and code examples are safe, copyright-free, and reliable.

### VII. Modular Snippets
Exercises and code snippets must be modular and independent.

## Technology Stack

The technology stack will be decided and documented here. For now, it is open, but choices should align with the principles of this constitution.

## Development Workflow

The development workflow will follow GitFlow principles for content updates. Key practices include:
- All changes must be submitted via Pull Requests.
- Major updates require approval from a project lead before being merged.

## Governance

This constitution is the guiding document for the project. Amendments require a formal proposal, review, and approval from the project leads. All development practices and decisions must align with these principles.
